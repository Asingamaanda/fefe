# 🚀 Enhanced AI with Gemini & OpenAI Integration

## Current vs Enhanced Comparison

### **Current System (DistilBERT)**
❌ Limited context understanding (1000 tokens max)
❌ Basic question-answering only
❌ No creative content generation
❌ Limited educational explanations
❌ No multi-language support
❌ No code generation capabilities

### **Enhanced System (Gemini + OpenAI)**
✅ **Massive context windows** (1M+ tokens for Gemini)
✅ **Creative educational content** generation
✅ **Interactive lesson planning**
✅ **Multi-modal learning** (text, images, diagrams)
✅ **Personalized tutoring** approaches
✅ **Code examples** and simulations
✅ **Multi-language** curriculum support
✅ **Advanced reasoning** and explanations
