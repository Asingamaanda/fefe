### 🚀 How to Experience the Conversational AI

#### Option 1: Use the Test Interface
1. Open `test-conversational-ai.html` in your browser
2. The AI will greet you warmly when you start
3. Try different types of questions:
   - **Casual**: "Hello! How are you?"
   - **Learning**: "Can you explain photosynthesis?"
   - **Encouragement**: "I'm struggling with math"
   - **General**: "What can you help me with?"

#### Option 2: Backend API Integration
```javascript
// Start a conversation
POST /api/ai-learning/conversation/start
// Response includes session_id and friendly greeting

// Ask questions conversationally
POST /api/ai-learning/ask/conversational
{
  "question": "Hello! Can you help me learn about chemistry?",
  "session_id": "user_123_20240101_120000"
}
```

### 🎭 Personality Examples

#### Before (Robotic):
> "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy. It occurs in chloroplasts."

#### After (Conversational):
> "Great question! I love that you're curious about this! So photosynthesis is basically how plants make their own food - it's like their kitchen! Here's how I like to think about it: plants take sunlight (like their energy source), water from their roots, and carbon dioxide from the air, and mix them all together in these tiny green factories called chloroplasts..."

### 🛠️ Technical Implementation

#### New Backend Routes:
- `/conversation/start` - Start new conversation session
